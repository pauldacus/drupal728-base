A Features-built module for easily getting a ~7.28 Drupal installation going with Omega4, Panels, and Panels Everywhere.

I have another repo (sass_omega4_base) with a sass-based responsive singularity grid that can be dropped into the sass folder.

This project is simply for expediting the easy & quick dropping of dependencies (themes, modules, libraries) into the sites/all folder of a 7.x Drupal project, and getting Panels & PE going pretty quickly.
